      <!-- mission statement -->
      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>At AG Web Design, I believe that people who need a website have a right to find someone who can create a professional-grade website at a fraction of the cost and time of the leading competitors.
      <br><br>You have found that company.</p>
      <!-- ideals section -->
      <h2>Ideals</h2>
      <p class="ideals">Before I begin a project with any customer, I make sure we are on the same page. We determine the price before starting, and we discuss the plans for the finished project.
      <br><br>I believe that a beautiful and unique website can make all the difference for a business. Prospective customers will more than likely not use your business if your website looks like it was carelessly made; they will think that is how you feel about the business, even if that is not the case.
      <br><br>Every website I make will meet these three standards:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The website is easy to navigate and read.</li>
          <li>The website is aesthetically pleasing.</li>
          <li>The website has all of the needed information for that business.</li>
        </ol>
      <p class="ideals">I also think that the customer asking me to create a website should have a major role in envisioning the site. It is <b>not</b> completely up to me to create a website. I need to know  what the customer is wanting the site to do and how they want it to look, otherwise I will not accept the job.</p>
      <!-- about me -->
      <h2>About the Designer</h2>
      <img class="profile" align="right" src="img/alyssa.png">
      <p style="display: inline; text-align: justify;">My name is Alyssa Gowan and I have been coding for a little over a year. I am fluent in HTML, CSS, and Ruby; and am currently learning PHP, Python, and creating apps for mobile devices. I am passionate about creating websites and am currently planning to pursue it as a career.</p>
      <p class="about-designer">Last year, I was given the opportunity to visit San Francisco, where I toured LinkedIn, Google, and Stanford University. This only reinforced my love of coding, and I am extremely grateful to have seen what advice professionals in the technology industy have to give to people like myself.</p>
      <p>I would <b>love</b> to create a website for you!</p>
